# AI-Energy-Consumption-Forecaster
Description:

The "Energy Consumption Forecasting for Optimization" project aims to provide a sophisticated solution for utility companies to predict energy consumption patterns, enabling efficient energy generation and distribution. By harnessing the power of advanced time series forecasting techniques and incorporating external factors, this project offers a robust tool for optimizing energy-related operations.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: The project begins with comprehensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values and smoothing data to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.

Feature Engineering: External factors such as holidays, weather conditions, and historical energy generation data are intelligently incorporated to capture complex seasonality and trend patterns.

Prophet Modeling: Leveraging the Prophet library, a highly flexible and powerful time series forecasting model is configured. Seasonal, weekly, daily, and yearly seasonality are meticulously modeled to capture intricate consumption behaviors.

Custom Holidays: The model is equipped with custom holiday definitions to account for special events and holidays that can significantly impact energy consumption.

Evaluation Metrics: Evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are employed to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness. Cross-validation can be performed for robust validation.

Advanced Visualization: The project offers advanced visualization capabilities, providing insight into energy consumption forecasts along with prediction intervals for better decision-making.

Optimization Insights: Utility companies can utilize the forecasts to optimize energy generation, distribution, and maintenance schedules, ultimately reducing operational costs and improving service reliability.

Scalability: The project can be scaled to handle large volumes of data and extended to consider additional features and factors as per specific utility company requirements.

This project represents a powerful tool for utility companies, enabling them to make data-driven decisions and optimize their energy-related operations, leading to cost savings and improved service quality. It showcases the potential of advanced time series forecasting and data-driven approaches in the energy sector.
